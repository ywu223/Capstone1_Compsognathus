# GTBC-Capstone 1: Correlation of Life Expectancy with Education

## Project Overview
In this capstone project, our group was interested in explore that whether life expectancy correlates with the level of education in 31 Europe countries from year 2008 to 2019.

## Project Structure
Three three sources of final code writen by individual of group member, and the code can be found in 
  * [project1john.ipynb](project1john.ipynb) by Jonh Clos who focused on working to find out the regression relations of education levels vs life expendacy.
  * [life.Rmd](life.Rmd) by Yuman Wu who focused on working on to general dataset for further EDA and regression analysis.
  * [Project_1_LingLv.ipynb](Project_1_LingLv.ipynb) by Ling  Lv who focused on working on the explorary data analysis (EDA).
   
Finally, our presentation summarazing our results can be found in the powerpoint file [Capstone1_Project_Presentation_LLv_JFCv2.pptx](Capstone1_Project_Presentation_LLv_JFCv2.pptx).

## Link to Datasets
* Population by Education Levels in Europe
  
    [population_by_education_level.csv](Datasets/population_by_education_level.csv) data includes variables as: education attainment level, age group, sex and geography in Europe. Dataset was downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/population-by-education-level-in-europe

* Life Expectancy at Birth in Europe
  
     [life_expectancy_at_birth.csv](Datasets/life_expectancy_at_birth.csv) data includes variables as: life expectacy in years at birth, sex and geography in Europe. Dataset was downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/life-expectancy-at-birth-in-europe

* Europe Country Abbreviations: 
  
  Data includes variables as geography in Europe and conresponding country name, and the Dataset is put into a csv file named [EU_Country_Codes.csv](Datasets/EU_Country_Codes.csv) 

* Dataset ready for analysis:
  
  The above three data sets finally were inner merged on variables: geography, date, sex into one csv file named [complete_dataset.csv](Datesets/complete_dataset.csv)
